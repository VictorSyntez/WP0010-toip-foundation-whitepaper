# Mission of the Trust over IP Foundation

The charter of the Trust over IP Foundation is to:

> Define a complete architecture for Internet-scale digital
> trust that combines cryptographic trust at the machine layer
> with human trust at the business, legal, and social layers.  

Note that this mission is not to develop all of the standards or components included in
the ToIP stack â€” rather it is to specify how these elements can be combined to fulfill the
requirements of all four layers of the stack, for both governance and technology. This
means the ToIP Foundation will work closely with other standards development
organizations (SDOs), industry foundations, and other consortia to combine their open
standards, architectures, and protocols into a complete and coherent stack for
Internet-scale digital trust infrastructure.

Note that the organizations listed are those whose work is either referenced by or
contributing to some portion of the ToIP stack. We expect this roster of relationships to
grow as our work on the ToIP stack advances through the ToIP Foundation Working
Groups.
