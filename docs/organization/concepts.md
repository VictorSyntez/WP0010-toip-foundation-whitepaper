The founders of the Trust over IP Foundation chose the Linux Foundation (LF) as our
home for the simple reason that it hosts the largest and most successful open source
projects in the world. Besides Linux itself, the LF hosts over 240 independent projects
including the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, Automotive Grade Linux, Carrier
Grade Linux, the R Consortium, the Node.js Foundation, and the GraphQL Foundation.

Secondly, the LF is already the home of two directly related peer projects:
1. [**Hyperledger​**](https://www.hyperledger.org/), the umbrella organization hosting over a dozen projects for advancing blockchain technology for business. Three Hyperledger projects —​ [Indy](https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/indy),​ [​Ursa​](https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/ursa/), and [​Aries​](https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/aries/) — implement key components of the ToIP stack.
2. [**Decentralized Identity Foundation**](https://identity.foundation/) ​(DIF), a membership organization building foundational components of open, standards-based decentralized identity. DIF is currently the home of the [DIDComm Working Group](https://identity.foundation/working-groups/did-comm.html)​ — the “narrow waist” protocol at the heart of Layer Two of the ToIP stack. DIF also hosts several other Working Groups focused on DIDs, secure data storage, and other aspects of the stack.
