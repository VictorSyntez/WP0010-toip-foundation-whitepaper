# The Governance Trust Triangle

While some credentials only have a single issuer, others can be issued by many
issuers. For example, passports are issued by hundreds of countries, and credit cards
are issued by tens of thousands of banks and credit unions. For any credential that will
be widely used by many holders and honored by many verifiers, there is a second trust
triangle — **the ​ governance trust triangle**​ — as shown below.

A governance authority can represent any set of issuers who want to standardize the
business, legal, and technical policies for issuing, holding, and verifying a set of
credentials. A governance authority can take any form — government, consortia,
cooperative — but the purpose is the same: publish a **governance framework**​ that
documents the rules by which the members of a trust community agreed to abide.
