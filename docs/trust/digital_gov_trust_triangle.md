# Economy-Scale Digital Trust

With verifiable credentials and digital wallets, we can use the same trust model—and
mental model—as we use with physical credentials and wallets. Furthermore, we can
use governance frameworks ​ *to adapt this model to any trust community and scale it to
any size trust network*. ​ This ​ **digital governance trust triangle**​ is shown below.

As this diagram suggests, digital governance frameworks are the backbone of this new
era of digital trust. Every digital credential in your wallet should be backed by a
governance framework that spells out the business, legal, and technical rules under
which that credential operates. By combining the technical trust of W3C Verifiable
Credentials and DIDs with the human trust codified in these governance frameworks,
we can finally usher in a new era of Internet-scale digital trust infrastructure.
