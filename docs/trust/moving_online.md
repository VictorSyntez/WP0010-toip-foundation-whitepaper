It’s easy to forget that, with the Internet of today where consumers and businesses
across all sectors participate in a global digital economy of unprecedented scale and

networks (Compuserve, MCI Mail, AOL), and finally the worldwide “network of networks”
now known as the Internet. And at each step, the gap between how we establish trust
offline and how we do it online was widening. Why?
